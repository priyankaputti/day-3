The IdeaBoard web application is a lightweight, browser-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to submit creative ideas by entering their name and idea text through a form. Upon submission, the idea is dynamically added to the list of submitted ideas on the page. Behind the scenes, JavaScript handles the form submission, validates input fields, and stores the data locally using the browserâ€™s localStorage API. This ensures that even if the page is refreshed, previously submitted ideas remain visible. The clean and responsive layout is styled using custom CSS, making the app visually appealing and user-friendly. Since the app doesn't require a backend, it can be run entirely on the client side, making it ideal for hackathons, brainstorming events, or as a beginner web development project.
